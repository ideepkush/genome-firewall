"""Genome Firewall — S. aureus antibiotic-response decision support.

Three surfaces, in the order the brief describes the system:

  Cohort      the real BV-BRC laboratory phenotypes this project is scoped to
  Predict     an assembled genome -> per-antibiotic call, evidence, calibrated confidence
  Validation  held-out performance and how each responsibility requirement is met

The model is fitted on 1,675 real S. aureus genomes carrying AMRFinderPlus determinants
and laboratory susceptibility results.

One caveat is surfaced wherever the metrics appear. The supplied grouping assigned 1,861
groups to 1,863 genomes - 99.9% singletons - so a "grouped" split over it is a random
split and offers no protection against near-identical isolates landing on both sides.
We re-cluster on the determinant profile and report that instead. It costs 0.17
balanced accuracy on tetracycline, and that is the point: the higher number is the one
a random split would have let us publish.

| Requirement | How |
|---|---|
| **Defensive by construction** | Predicts and explains resistance that already exists. No generative capability anywhere in the codebase. |
| **Honest generalization** | Split by genetic lineage, never by row. `verify_no_leakage` raises *before* training. Per-lineage metrics above, worst case included. Covered species and drugs stated in the sidebar. |
| **Calibrated confidence + no-call** | Calibrated on a split disjoint from train and test. Probabilities inside the band return no-call, and a no-call carries no confidence figure — there is no claim to be confident about. |
| **Honest explanations** | A curated determinant is reported separately from a bare statistical association. A coefficient is never presented as biological cause. A failure call must cite a detected determinant or it is downgraded to no-call. |
| **Human oversight** | Lab-confirmation warning on every report. The tool makes no treatment decision. |
