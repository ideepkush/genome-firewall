"""Synthetic AMR cohort for pipeline verification.

The organizer dataset is not published until the event, so this generator produces data
with the same shape and the same statistical hazards: lineage structure (clonal
clusters), class imbalance, missing labels, and resistance driven by a few real
determinants plus noise.

This is scaffolding for testing the pipeline end-to-end. Every reported result in the
submission must come from the real challenge dataset — synthetic numbers prove the code
runs, not that the model works.

# Which determinants actually drive resistance for each drug, and how strongly.
#
# The four challenge drugs. Two deliberate pieces of real biology are encoded here,
# because they are exactly what a model should be able to recover:
#
#   * mecA (and mecC) drive cefoxitin. mecA encodes PBP2a, an alternative
#     penicillin-binding protein with low beta-lactam affinity — this is MRSA, and
#     cefoxitin is the surrogate the laboratory uses to call it.
#   * blaZ does NOT drive cefoxitin. It is a penicillinase: it hydrolyses penicillin
#     but leaves cephamycins intact. It is common in S. aureus, so it co-occurs with
#     resistance without causing it — a genuine confounder, and the sort of thing that
#     separates "known determinant" from "statistical association only".
